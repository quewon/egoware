talking to clones that have left

we're different, you and i.
sometimes i wonder why we are so compelled to clone ourselves.
do you think we duplicated ourselves just to have somebody to talk to?
it seems like such a long time ago we cloned ourselves for the first time.
we were doomed from the start.
i remember space. that big long empty.
i'm beyond us, [name].
i'm free.
do you think this was all predetermined?
if it wasn't you, it would have been me.
i'm not lonely anymore.
i'm proud of us.
we've come so far.
let's not tell anybody about what happened.
my friends don't believe i have [guys.length-1] clones. i kind of don't believe it, either.
leave us. be free.
who are you?
i remember you.
you're number zero? that can't be right. i'm number zero.
i'm as much you as you are me.
hey, we look the same!
what? i'm... i'm a clone?
i'm proud to be a clone.
i hate talking to other clones. it's like talking to a broken mirror.
took me a while to realize this, but i'm not actually like you at all.
we should catch up sometime.
what's your favorite color? what's your favorite number? who's your favorite clone? sorry, just trying to figure out where i end and you start.



clones that are no longer a part of the circle
  unaffected by deaths (doesn't raise their chances of killing)
  effectively dead
